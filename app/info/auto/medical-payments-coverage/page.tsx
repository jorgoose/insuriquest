          Understanding Medical Payments Coverage 🚑
        </h2>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Medical Payments Coverage, often referred to as "MedPay", helps pay
          for medical or funeral expenses for you or your passengers after a car
          accident, regardless of who was at fault. It can also cover you as a
          pedestrian if you're hit by a vehicle.

            John is driving with a friend when they get into a minor accident.
            Both have minor injuries requiring medical treatment. John's Medical
            Payments Coverage would help pay for the medical bills for both of
            them, even if John was at fault.

            accident, no matter who was responsible.
